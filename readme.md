# AI-Resistant Assessment Formats

## Overview

This project demonstrates innovative question formats designed to prevent AI-assisted cheating in online assessments and examinations. With the rise of powerful AI language models, traditional assessment methods have become vulnerable to cheating through screenshot-based AI analysis. These formats provide a solution by obscuring critical data from AI tools while remaining fully accessible to human test-takers.

## Demo Contents

This demonstration includes:

1. **Landing Page (index.html)**

   - Overview of both assessment formats
   - Technical explanation of how they work
   - Accessibility features overview

2. **Audio Reveal Format (audio-reveal.html)**

   - Example math problem with audio-hidden values
   - Fully keyboard-navigable interface
   - Screen reader compatibility

3. **Data Reveal Format (data-reveal.html)**
   - Example math problem with interactive hover/click reveals
   - Timed auto-hide functionality
   - Full accessibility support

## Key Benefits for Assessment Providers

### Test Integrity

- Prevents candidates from using AI tools to solve questions
- Disrupts screenshot-based cheating methods
- Maintains the integrity of your assessment process

### Accessibility Compliance

- Meets WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards
- Works with all major screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support for users with motor disabilities

### Ease of Implementation

- Built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- No complex backend requirements
- Can be integrated into existing assessment platforms

## Technical Approach

These formats employ two distinct methods to obscure content from AI:

1. **Audio Synthesis** - Critical values are converted to audio, which current AI systems cannot process from screenshots.

2. **Interactive Reveals** - Important data is hidden until user interaction, making it impossible to capture in a static screenshot.

Both approaches maintain full accessibility through carefully designed keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Customization Possibilities

These demos represent proof-of-concept implementations. With further development, we could enhance them with:

- Custom styling to match your brand
- Integration with your existing assessment platform
- Randomized question generation
- More sophisticated data protection techniques
- Analytics to track potential cheating attempts
- Additional question format variations

## Next Steps

We'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how these approaches could be tailored to your specific assessment needs. These prototypes demonstrate the concept, but we can develop fully production-ready implementations that integrate seamlessly with your existing systems.
